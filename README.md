Well, after recruiting you guys into <b>the Robotics Club</b>, we faced many delays in conducting this part that we've been following as a tradition. So it's the time!! 
And the legacy has been passed to our batch to train you guys for the future events that you're going to do. After talking to ourselves and a brainstorming session we thought to try something different. It turned out this. We hope you learn and enjoy this process
